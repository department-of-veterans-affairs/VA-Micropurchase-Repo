This is the list of deliverables to complete the API Outreach Microconsulting Project. 


## Key Deliverable: 
A repeatable process, grounded in user research, that can be applied to each family of VA APIs/services.

To accomplish this, we provided the following deliverables:
- Discovery readout
- Long term success metrics for outreach strategy
- Marketing and outreach materials for one target persona
- Template/toolbox for repeating for other personas
- Initial backlog/inventory of personas and APIs (to be fully filled out by VA or through a different engagement)
- Retrospective
