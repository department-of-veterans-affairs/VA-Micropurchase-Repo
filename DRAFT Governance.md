# Microconsulting Work Statement – Governance #

### Background 
The Lighthouse program is moving VA towards an Application Programming Interface (API) first driven digital enterprise, which will establish the next generation open management platform for Veterans and accelerate transformation in VA's core functions, such as Health, Benefits, Burial and Memorials. This platform will be a system for designing, developing, publishing, operating, monitoring, analyzing, iterating and optimizing VA’s API ecosystem.

### The Play
As the VA Lighthouse Product Owner I have identified the need to establish a governance model for the Lighthouse program.   The goal of the governance model is to ensure that current and future API development work will comply with all appropriate standards and ensure the effective and efficient use of IT in support of VA mission goals. 

I need an outline developed for this governance model that includes at a minimum:

- API development, deployment and maintenance standards
- Componentized architecture and data standards to facilitate re-use
- Security standards and a user rights/permissions model
- Governance team staffing model, including key roles and staffing levels
- Governance group(s), including definitions, roles and member composition

### Deliverable
Draft version of the governance model outline in markdown language.  Other file formats that best communicate the governance model may be used.

Deliverables shall be submitted to VA's GitHub Repo.

### Definition of Done
- Submission to VA GitHub
- ???

### Time Box
VA anticipates a 2 week iteration to be sufficient. Vendors may propose alternate time frame for VA's consideration.

### Disclaimer
In performance of this effort, the contractor shall not perform a function that requires access to a VA system or VA sensitive information (e.g., system administrator privileged access to a VA system, or contractor systems or processes that utilize VA sensitive information). Additionally, the contractor shall not connect one or more contractor-owned IT devices to a VA internal trusted network. Finally, this acquisition does not involve the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information.

### Evaluation
- Vendor shall detail a proposed approach to developing the governance model.
- Vendor shall provide a fixed price for the entire work effort.
- Government will determine which proposal is most beneficial to the Government.
