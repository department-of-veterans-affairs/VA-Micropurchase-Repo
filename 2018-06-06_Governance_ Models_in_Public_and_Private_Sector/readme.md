# Microconsulting Work Statement - Governance Models in Public and Private Sector

### Background 
VA has the need to establish a governance model for the Lighthouse program. The goal of the governance model is to create standardized processes for deciding (1) the prioritization of which APIs to build, (2) the data models and standards to which to build the APIs (such as dates and times should follow RFC 3339), (3) how to get the APIs to production usage, and (4) how to make the APIs valuable to third party consumers. VA believes each of these processes should follow a standard policy driven approach based on private and public sector best practices and this governance model will define how VA builds and manages APIs.  

It is not anticipated that this work will conflict the Contractor out of future Lighthouse work.  Any OCI concern can be directed to the Contracting Officer. 

### The Play
As the VA Lighthouse Product Owner seeking the appropriate Governance model, I would like to understand, with the intention to adopt, best practices from the private and public sector, specifically for prioritizing APIs to build, standards to which to build APIs, and making the APIs usable by external consumers.  We would like the primary research performed to gather best practices around:
- Characteristics of effective models in the public and private sector, and who is successfully using them. 
- Lessons learned from these organizations (both what is working and what isn't)
- Highlight strengths and weaknesses of selected governance models. 

The Contractor shall participate in a combined retrospective upon completion of performance estimated to be one hour in duration. 

### Deliverable
- Vendor shall highlight strengths and weaknesses for selected VA governance models based on best practices learned from the evaluated entities. Data shall be presented to VA in the most appropriate way, as defined in the proposal.
- Vendor shall provide all data/research learned from each entity to build the recommendation.

### Definition of Done
- Deliverable representative of the effort described in vendor's proposal.
- Submission to VA GitHub as .md file, or other submission as described in the proposal. 

### Time Box
VA anticipates a 2-week iteration to be sufficient. 2-week iteration shall start on an agreed upon date. Vendors may propose alternate time frame for VA's consideration.

### Disclaimer
In performance of this effort, the contractor shall not perform a function that requires access to a VA system or VA sensitive information (e.g., system administrator privileged access to a VA system, or contractor systems or processes that utilize VA sensitive information). Additionally, the contractor shall not connect one or more contractor-owned IT devices to a VA internal trusted network. Finally, this acquisition does not involve the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information.

### Evaluation
- Vendor shall describe their ability to collect information from public and private entities to evaluate their governance models and present them in the most logical way.
- Vendor shall provide a fixed price for the entire work effort.
- Government will determine which proposal is most beneficial to the Government.
- Government reserves the right to award to multiple vendors as a result of this RFQ.

Submissions shall be made to the following email addresses by 3pm ET, May 23, 2018.
