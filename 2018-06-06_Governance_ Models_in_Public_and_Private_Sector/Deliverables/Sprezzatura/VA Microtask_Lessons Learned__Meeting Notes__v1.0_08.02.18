Team -



 



Meeting scheduled to discuss lessons learned
and perform a brief retrospective on this microtasker.



 



Let me know if there are any questions prior
to the meeting. Thank you.



 



 



V/R,

From the PPT (initial thoughts)



 



Research & Analysis Process (primary areas
of Lessons Learned)

Evangelism

Authorization (I.e. Whitelisting/Blacklisting)

Maximizing Developer Experience

Enterprise Architecture

CI/DC Support & Documentation in a
Federated Environment

Performing the Microtask Work

Create a mini IMS containing a start date,
milestones and end date.

When cold calling for information make sure
the vendor understands that it is not a sales inquiry

Follow the questionnaire questions flow more
closely (aids in better note taking)

Record ALL interview calls for reference back,
as needed.

Maintain a focus on specific research elements
related to APIs (such as DEV versus Governance). Smart for VA to take that
approach in doling out Microtaskers.

Recommendations for Additional Microtask Work
Areas

I.e. API Risks & Security, Performance
Metrics, Enhancements, etc.





























 



 



 



PPT ‘Speaker Notes’ section: We
identified usable lessons learned in the areas of evangelism, authorization
(whitelisting/blacklisting), maximizing developer experience, enterprise
architecture, CI/DC support and documentation in a federated environment, among
others.



 



*Per our proposal: Sprint
Retrospective - Separate from presenting our research and analysis, we’ll also
conduct a one-hour Sprint Retrospective with VA where we will critique our
efforts and provide VA with lessons learned that may be applied to further
research and Microtaskings.

Focus of this session: Process of working the microtask.



 



NOTES:



Responding to the microtask. Good
to respond in a public forum through the draft RFI process.

Good thing to having sharing
online (including others that responded to the microtask; seeing things out on
GitHub shared).

DRAFT PWS in a public forum was a
step forward with the microtask process.

Collaborative approach,
flexibility for interactions, as well as timeframe for deliverables (putting
quality over rigid timeframes)

Period of performance is 2-4 weeks
(helpful time frame).

Maximized the value of each call
with the interviewees; opportunity to do things better (I.e. get interview
questions to those being interviewed ahead of time to aid in the call structure
and interview process).

Establish expectations for
follow-up at the end of each call.

Were the subject matter experts
knowledgeable? Ready to share data?

Yes. Had some really great calls.
Lots of experience out there in both the private and public sectors.

Glad to hear that we were able to
contact some of the ‘heavy hitters’ in this API space.

Was the 4 week window long enough?

Yes. Flexibility is key. Ran into
some vacation time at the beginning.

Our approach to the micro task was
focused, but definitely not dedicated resources.

Difficult to respond to other
available microtasks while working on the current microtask.

Resource constraints; dollar
constraints. Difficult to perform work on multiple microtasks at the same time.
Challenge of the microtask model.

Should add more time to respond to
the microtask RFIs (14 days versus 7 days)? Yes, would be good.

OK. Change we will see coming is
adding more pages allowed for the response.

We think that a 1-2 page limit is
good for something this size.

This is different than larger
proposals that would require more pages and content.

Encourage folks to respond in 1-2
pages (target); up to 5 pages acceptable.

It is possible that the VA might
keep seeing the same organizations responding to these microtasks over time
(could be good, could be challenging, or could be neutral). Might want to
proactively address this through the RFI process in some fashion (like encouraging
new entries while maintaining connections with those that have already
contributed to the API Platform/microtask activities).

Would the VA be interested in
reaching out directly to POCs that we contacted?

Would start with us as the warm
follow-up to get more data.

Level of effort of the total team
combined. Was $10K enough to cover the time we put into it?

It sounds like it is ok to
follow-up with the government and say that we can do ‘x’ amount of work for the
$10K.

We want to provide a quality product;
time and resource constraints factor into that equation.

Overall, we will be on the edge of
that dollar amount for time and effort expended.

Team working on the microtask is
key (I.e. an experience team is key). IMS would be good to have listing out
milestone dates (etc) to help keep things on track. Our team worked well
together.

Standard format that the microtask
RFIs/PWSs have; keeping things streamlined and lightweight/Agile.

Might be beneficial to have more
ready made templates for the microtask work (thinking in terms of doing more of
these in the future; having a standard schedule template, questionnaire format,
meeting notes format, etc).

Appreciated the nimbleness and
flexibility, and the streamlined nature of the process (including the RFI/proposal
process, the open door policy to ask questions of the government, the flexible
time frame offered for working on and completion of the deliverables). Truly,
an Agile approach.

Courtney is the POC for
micro-purchases (90% of them). Open to receiving more feedback from us in the
future (related to the microtask proposal process, etc).

Like kickoff meeting format (I.e.
focus on us as the vendor; forum for us to ask our initial questions, get good
direction at the onset, level set expectations, etc).

Various initiatives had multiple
winners. Reminder that others are utilizing GitHub for their deliverable
uploads (as directed). So, everything uploaded to GitHub is visible 

Great working on this microtask in
support of the veterans

API Evangelism was mentioned a
couple of time. Important element to keep in mind and promote in this work
area.

API Platform/Lighthouse Platform =
RFI at a grander scale is out there

Question: Sprezzatura is closely
tracking this one; A lot DEV work and API Governance blended together in there;
Will there be two separate RFIs for each piece, or kept in this combined form
(Product and Services type piece). Directed us back to the contracting office
to ask this formal question

Courtney works for the API
Executive Director (Drew Myklegard)

Next steps:

Courtney to send Thomas the GitHub
link again [Received].

There are billing instructions out
there (?); will go and look after the call.

Thomas to follow-up with Joe and
the team regarding deliverables completion, uploading to GitHub, and any
remaining follow-up items like getting ou invoice over to the government for
processing and payment
